# Deep-Learning-MXNet
Deep Learning with MXNet

There are many cool frameworks for building deep learning models:  PyTorch, Tensorflow, Theano, MxNet. We need a framework that scales well. Almost all of these have multi-GPU support built in; MxNet provides the easiest abstractions to do this and works well with AWS as well as Colab. I will be building neural networks in MxNet to solve an interesting problem.

Deep learning or neural network architectures have been used to solve a multitude of problems in various different fields like vision, natural language processing, and radiology. 

I will be appling CNNs to solve an image classification problem.
